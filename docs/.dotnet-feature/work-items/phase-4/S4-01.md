# S4-01: Implement Vector Clock

> **Summary:** Implement vector clocks for causality tracking and conflict detection, supporting increment, merge, and happens-before comparison operations.

**Priority:** P0  
**Estimate:** 4 hours  
**Dependencies:** None

## Description

Implement vector clocks for causality tracking and conflict detection.

## Tasks

1. Create `VectorClock.cs` class
2. Implement increment operation
3. Implement merge operation
4. Implement comparison (concurrent, happens-before)
5. Support serialization/deserialization

## Key Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Increment(clientId)` | Increase client's entry by 1 |
| `Merge(other)` | Take max of all entries |
| `HappensBefore(other)` | Check causal ordering |
| `IsConcurrent(other)` | Check if concurrent (conflict) |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Increment increases client's entry by 1
- [ ] Merge takes max of all entries
- [ ] HappensBefore correctly identifies causality
- [ ] IsConcurrent correctly identifies concurrency
- [ ] Equality comparison works
- [ ] Serialization round-trip works
