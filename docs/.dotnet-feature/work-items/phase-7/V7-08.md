**Priority:** P0  
**Estimate:** 2 hours  
**Dependencies:** V7-02 through V7-07

## Description

Generate comprehensive test report documenting compatibility.

## Report Template

```markdown
# SyncKit .NET Server Compatibility Report

## Summary

| Test Category | Pass | Fail | Skip | Total |
|--------------|------|------|------|-------|
| Binary Protocol | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| Integration | 244 | 0 | 0 | 244 |
| Load | 73 | 0 | 0 | 73 |
| Chaos | 86 | 0 | 0 | 86 |
| **Total** | **410** | **0** | **0** | **410** |

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | TypeScript | .NET | Difference |
|--------|-----------|------|------------|
| p50 Latency | 8ms | 6ms | -25% |
| p99 Latency | 45ms | 35ms | -22% |
| Throughput | 8000 msg/s | 12000 msg/s | +50% |
| Memory (1k conn) | 400MB | 280MB | -30% |

## Protocol Compatibility

- ✅ JSON protocol: Fully compatible
- ✅ Binary protocol: Fully compatible
- ✅ Auto-detection: Working correctly
- ✅ All message types: Supported

## Known Differences

1. **Message ID generation**: .NET uses GUID instead of nanoid
   - Impact: None (IDs are opaque strings)

## Test Artifacts

- Full test logs: `results/full-logs.txt`
- Performance data: `results/performance.json`
- Coverage report: `results/coverage/`
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Report includes all test categories
- [ ] Pass/fail counts accurate
- [ ] Performance comparison included
- [ ] Known differences documented
- [ ] Artifacts preserved
