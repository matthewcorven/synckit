**Priority:** P0  
**Estimate:** 4 hours  
**Dependencies:** V7-03

## Description

Run and pass all 73 load tests to verify performance under stress.

## Load Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Connections | Messages/sec | Duration |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Basic load | 100 | 1000 | 60s |
| High connections | 1000 | 500 | 60s |
| High throughput | 100 | 10000 | 30s |
| Sustained | 500 | 2000 | 300s |
| Burst | 100 | 50000 | 10s |

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| p50 latency | <10ms | Median response time |
| p99 latency | <100ms | Tail latency |
| Throughput | >5000 msg/s | Single instance |
| Memory | <500MB | 1000 connections |
| CPU | <80% | Under load |

## Validation Command

```bash
cd tests
SYNCKIT_SERVER_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws bun test load/
```

## Performance Comparison

```bash
# Generate comparison report
bun run load:compare --baseline=typescript --target=dotnet
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 73 load tests pass
- [ ] p99 latency <100ms
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Graceful degradation under overload
- [ ] Performance within 20% of TypeScript
